The Odin Project HTML Recipe Project

First Project from The Odin Projects Foundation Course

Learning basic HTML structure, how to include images, links, lists, etc.

Things to improve= Git (Still not feeling very comfortable with Git will need to put more focus on it)

Overall though I enjoyed making this!
